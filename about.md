## App Description: 

This application is a demonstration of Wild Me's image identification pipeline, which we call WBIA (Wildbook Image Analysis Server). WBIA provides a multi-stage pipeline for finding one or more animals of one or more species in photos and then routing each detected animal on to the correct individual ID algorithm. WBIA also supports a plug-and-play approach to integrating and wrapping third party machine learning (e.g., new ID algorithms emerging from academic research or competitions), allowing it to serve as the easiest and fastest way to get new AI techniques into the hands of wildlife researchers in the field. Ultimately, the purpose of WBIA is to allow users of Wildbook to more rapidly curate large volumes of wildlife photography in support of research and population analysis.

The code is open source and available on [Github](https://github.com/WildMeOrg/sage-identification-pipeline).

## Products Used in the App: 

**H2O Wave:** H2O Wave is an open-source Python development framework that makes it fast and easy for data scientists, machine learning engineers, and software developers to develop real-time interactive AI apps with sophisticated visualizations.

## Partnership Descriptions: 
[Wild Me](https://www.wildme.org/#/): part of H2O.ai's AI for Good program. Wild Me creates web-based, multi-user software platforms to help researchers collaboratively track individual animals in wildlife populations and estimate population sizes. At the time of this writing, Wild Me maintains 16 different platforms (Wildbooks) supporting hundreds of different species. Image detection, classification, and identification are available on [each of the Wildbook platforms](https://www.wildme.org/#/platforms).
